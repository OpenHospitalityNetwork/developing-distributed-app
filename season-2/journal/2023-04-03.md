Figuring out how to send email notifications based on notifications in inbox

## Solid notifications

I've read [Solid Notifications Protocol](https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol), but i didn't manage to find any [Notification Channel Types](https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol#notification-channel-types). I fetched a document, looked at its `link: <https://solidweb.me/id-mrkvon-org/inbox/.meta>; rel="describedby"` header. And there in `.meta` there's nothing about notifications. I tried CSS and NSS. That's that.

I asked at solid/notification-panel matrix channel.

And they very kindly answered. Specification is relatively stable, there is [PR in CSS](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer/pull/1565), and not much implementation going on, yet.

I ran the code of that PR. When fetching any resource from the pod of `asdf`, there is a header `Link: <http://localhost:3000/asdf/.well-known/solid>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#storageDescription"`.

We fetch `http://localhost:3000/asdf/.well-known/solid` and receive

```ttl
<http://localhost:3000/asdf/.well-known/solid>
    a <http://www.w3.org/ns/pim/space#Storage>;
    <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#subscription>
        <http://localhost:3000/.notifications/WebSocketChannel2023/>,
        <http://localhost:3000/.notifications/WebHookSubscription2021/>.
<http://localhost:3000/.notifications/WebSocketChannel2023/>
    <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#channelType> <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#WebSocketChannel2023>;
    <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#feature>
        <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#accept>,
        <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#endAt>,
        <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#rate>,
        <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#startAt>,
        <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#state>.
<http://localhost:3000/.notifications/WebHookSubscription2021/>
    <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#channelType> <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#WebHookSubscription2021>;
    <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#feature>
        <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#accept>,
        <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#endAt>,
        <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#rate>,
        <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#startAt>,
        <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#state>,
        <notify:webhookAuth>;
    <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#webid> <http://localhost:3000/.notifications/WebHookSubscription2021/webId>.
```

And then, fetching `http://localhost:3000/.notifications/WebSocketChannel2023/` we get

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notification/v1"
  ],
  "id": "http://localhost:3000/.notifications/WebSocketChannel2023/",
  "channelType": "http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notifications#WebSocketChannel2023",
  "feature": [
    "accept",
    "endAt",
    "rate",
    "startAt",
    "state"
  ]
}
```
It kind of says that websockets and webhooks are supported, webhooks might be a bit outdated; and it doesn't tell us how to use them.
