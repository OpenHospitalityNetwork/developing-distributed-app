# Developing a distributed app to connect people

In a series of articles we document how we build a distributed hospitality exchange over [Solid Protocol](https://solidproject.org).

We do this together with the folks of [Open Hospitality Network](https://openhospitality.network/)[^ohn]. I write these texts in a personal way, but the project is a community effort.

[^ohn]: [Open Hospitality Network](https://openhospitality.network/) is an effort to design and build a next generation hospitality exchange platform. One that would be federated (decentralized and interconnected) in order to address the issues and the long-term consequances many hospex communities have faced over the years of existance. We believe these issues are related to the centralized infrastructure they've been built on.
