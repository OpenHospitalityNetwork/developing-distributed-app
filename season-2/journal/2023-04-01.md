## Contacts

Implementing contacts. As usually, the most difficult part is a lack of design.

When it comes to contacts, we just want to make people establish 2-directional `foaf:knows` relationship. Right now, we save the contact in personal profile document. But it's not always an ideal place to save contacts, for example, the contact is public. It makes that document bloated. Or it's not even editable.

Some people like to save `:me foaf:knows otherPerson:me` in extended profile, which is linked from profile by `rdfs:seeAlso`. Or, we could save it to a hospex-specific place. Ah, what a difficulty!

We could probably try to search `foaf:knows` in a couple of places, and then we could add the new contact to the already existing ones.

[Graph approach](https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2022/12/30/lets-talk-about-pods/) would shine here. Document approach makes things complicated. Many places to save to, difficult to search in them.

When app adds a person as a contact, it also shares my hospex folder with them directly. So if the hospex community disappears, the relationships will stay. This is an interesting way to make the network fully decentralized, and we could explore this further.
