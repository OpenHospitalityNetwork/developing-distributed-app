# Project setup

So you want to make a social app with Solid, right?

So how do you start?

They say Solid apps don't need backend. So let's just start with frontend...

Let's start with something you know well. Create a React app. With TypeScript and redux, apparently...

```shell
yarn create react-app ohn-solid-client --template redux-typescript
```

Setup Prettier and linter. So code is nice. (add link to git commit)

Add workflow to deploy to github pages. Every commit to `main` branch will get deployed.

## Show a map

The central thingy of the app is a map which shows Offers from hosts.

So let's make one. With Leaflet.

Still no Solid going on, right?
